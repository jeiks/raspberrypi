*It is only a note*

#### How to change the sound output to *3.5mm audio jack* instead of *hdmi*:

It is simple. You must follow the steps:
```shellscript
sudo raspi-config
```
* First, select **Advanced Options**
* Then, select **Audio**
* Finally, select **Force 3.5mm (‘headphone’) jack**

To enable *HDMI output*, you have to follow the same steps, but selecting *Force HDMI* on the last step.
