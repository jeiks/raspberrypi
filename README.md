# Raspberrypi tricks

Since I bought my raspberry, I made several settings to adapt it to my needs.

I posted some of then at my [website](https://jeiks.net/2018/03/24/raspberry-tricks/).

Now I'm migrating posts here. The code and information will be more readable here than in Wordpress.

Feel free if you want to contribute or contact me.

### Tricks (and notes):

* [Spotify](Spotify)
* [Update Date and Time automatically](update_raspberry_datetime)
